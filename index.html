            <h1>YOUR little COVID-19 HELPER!</h1>
                <h2 id="section1">Conditions All Round The World</h2>
                <p>The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome. The novel virus was first identified from an outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019, and attempts to contain it there failed, allowing it to spread across the globe. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March 2020. As of 28 January 2022, the pandemic had caused more than 366 million cases and 5.63 million deaths, making it one of the deadliest in history.</p>

                <P>COVID-19 symptoms range from undetectable to deadly but most commonly include fever, dry cough, and fatigue. Severe illness is more likely in elderly patients and those with certain underlying medical conditions. COVIDâ€‘19 transmits when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets and small airborne particles containing the virus. The risk of breathing these in is highest when people are in close proximity, but they can be inhaled over longer distances, particularly indoors. Transmission can also occur if contaminated fluids reach the eyes, nose or mouth, and, rarely, via contaminated surfaces. Infected persons are typically contagious for 10 days, and can spread the virus even if they do not develop symptoms. Mutations have produced many strains (variants) with varying degrees of infectivity and virulence.</P>

                <p>Everyone ages 2 years and older should properly wear a well-fitting mask indoors in pulic in areas of substantial or high community transmission, regardless of vaccination status. It helps to prevent its spread to a great extent.</p>
                <h4>Stay 6 feet away from others</h4>
                <p>If you are not up to date on COVID-19 vaccines, stay at least 6 feet away from other people, especially if you are at higher risk of getting very sick with COVID-19.</p>

                <h4>Wash your hands often</h4>
                <p>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.</p>

                <h2 id="Covid-19Vaccination"> Covid-19 Vaccination </h2>
                <p>The vaccine reduces your risk of infection.
                    Once you receive your first shot, your body begins producing antibodies to the coronavirus. These antibodies help your immune system fight the virus if you happen to be exposed, so it reduces your chance of getting the disease.The vaccine protects against severe illness.
                    During studies, the three vaccines â€” Johnson & Johnson, Moderna and Pfizer â€” have shown to be effective at preventing severe illness from COVID-19. So if you are vaccinated and become infected, you are very unlikely to become severely ill.</p>
